# A few classical papers to start

In a series of now classical papersp Philip Green and co-workers has developed a quantitative framework for the analysis of data generated by automated DNA sequencers.

|<small>**Two papers** were published back to back in *Genome Research*|

In particular they developed a standard metric for describing the reliability of base calls:

>An important technical aspect of our work is the use of log-transformed error probabilities rather than untransformed ones, which facilitates working with error rates in the range of most importance (very close to 0). Specifically, we define the quality value q assigned to a base-call to be<br><br>
>$q = -10\times log_{10}(p)$<br><br>
> where p is the estimated error probability for that base-call. Thus a base-call having a probability of 1/1000 of being incorrect is assigned a quality value of 30. Note that high quality values correspond to low error probabilities, and conversely.

We will be using the concept of "*quality score*" or "*phred-scaled quality score*" repeatedly in this course. 

# Illumina

![](/img/illumina_pseudocolor.png)

Illumina (originally called "Solexa") uses glass flowcells with oligonucleotides permanently attached to internal surface. These oligonucleotides are complementary to sequencing adapters added to DNA fragments being sequenced during library preparation. The DNA fragments that are "stuck" on the flowcell due to complementary interaction between adapters are amplified via "bridge amplification" to form clusters. Sequencing is performed using reversible terminator chemistry with nucleotides modified to carry dyes specific to each base. As a result all nucleotides can be added at once and are distinguished by color. Currently, it is possible to sequence up to 300 bases from each end of the fragment being sequenced. Illumina has the highest throughput (and lowest cost per base) of all existing technologies at this moment. The NovaSeq 6000 machine can produce [6000 billion nucleotides in 44 hours](https://www.illumina.com/systems/sequencing-platforms.html). In this course we will most often work with Illumina data.

### 10X: A way to extend the utility of short Illumina reads

A company called [10X Genomics](http://www.10xgenomics.com/technology/) has developed a technology which labels reads derived from continuous fragments of genomic DNA. In this technology a gel bead covered with a large number of adapter molecules is placed within a droplet containing PCR reagents and one or several long molecules of genomic DNA to be sequenced.

The droplets are generated by combining beads, PCR reagents, and genomic DNA in a microfluidic device:

|<small>**10X workflow** (**a**) Gel beads loaded with primers and barcoded oligonucleotides are mixed with DNA and enzyme mixture then oil-surfactant solution at a microfluidic 'double-cross' junction. Gel beadâ€“containing droplets flow to a reservoir where gel beads are dissolved, initiating whole-genome primer extension. The products are pooled from each droplet. The final library preparation requires shearing the libraries and incorporation of Illumina adapters. (**b**) Top, linked reads of the ALK gene from the NA12878 WGS sample. Lines represent linked reads; dots represent reads; color indicates barcode. Middle, exon boundaries of the ALK gene. Bottom, linked reads of the ALK gene from the NA12878 exome data. Reads from neighboring exons are linked by common barcodes. Only a small fraction of linked reads is presented here.

In essence, 10X allows to uniquely map reads derived from long genomic fragments. This information is essential for bridging together genome and transcriptome assemblies as we will see in later in this course.
