      <description>The 60s and the 70s The first complete nucleic acids being sequenced were RNAs (tRNAs in particular; see pioneering work of Robert Holley and colleagues). The work on finding approaches to sequencing DNA molecules began in late 60s and early 70s. One of the earliest contributions has been made by Ray Wu from Cornell, who used E. coli DNA polymerase to incorporate radioactively labelled nucleotides into protruding ends of bacteriphage lambda.</description>

      <description>Why history? Knowing history is essential for understanding how we arrived to the current state of affairs in our field. It is also full of acciental discoveries and dramatic relationships making it quite interesting to read about. I strongly advise you to take a look at the mansucripts below.
Classical publications  1965 | A history of genetics 1943 | Delbruck &amp;amp; Luria 1944 | Avery, MacLeod, &amp;amp; McCarty 1952 | Herhey &amp;amp; Chase 1953 | Watson &amp;amp; Crick 1958 | Meselson &amp;amp; Stahl 1960 | Jacob and Monod  Popular (yet very informative) literature Get one of these and read it on a plane:</description>
