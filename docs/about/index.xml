Other violations include, but are not limited to, any attempt to gain an unfair advantage in regard to an examination, such as tampering with a graded exam or claiming another&amp;rsquo;s work to be one&amp;rsquo;s own. Other assessments (including ANGEL-administered quizzes and assessments as well as homework assignments) are expected to represent your own independent work unless specifically stated otherwise. Failure to comply will lead to sanctions against the student in accordance with the Policy on Academic Integrity in the Eberly College of Science. The Eberly College of Science Code of Mutual Respect and Cooperation (www.science.psu.edu/climate/Code-of-Mutual-Respect-final.pdf) embodies the values that we hope our faculty, staff, and students possess and will endorse to make The Eberly College of Science a place where every individual feels respected and valued, as well as challenged and rewarded.   The Eberly College of Science is committed to the academic success of students enrolled in the College&amp;rsquo;s  courses and undergraduate programs. When in need of help, students can utilize various College and University wide resources for learning assistance (&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.science.psu.edu/advising/success&#34;&gt;http://www.science.psu.edu/advising/success&lt;/a&gt;). Penn State welcomes students with disabilities into the University&amp;rsquo;s educational programs. If you have a disability-related need for reasonable academic adjustments in this course, contact the Office for Disability Services (ODS) at 814-863-1807 (V/TTY). For further information regarding ODS, please visit the Office for Disability Services Web site at &lt;a href=&#34;http://equity.psu.edu/ods/.  &#34;&gt;http://equity.psu.edu/ods/.  &lt;/a&gt; In order to receive consideration for course accommodations, you must contact ODS and provide documentation (see the &lt;a href=&#34;http://equity.psu.edu/ods/guidelines/documentation-guidelines&#34;&gt;documentation guidelines&lt;/a&gt;). If the documentation supports the need for academic adjustments, ODS will provide a letter identifying appropriate academic adjustments. Please share this letter and discuss the adjustments with your instructor as early in the course as possible. You must contact ODS and request academic adjustment letters at the beginning of each semester.&lt;/h6&gt;
