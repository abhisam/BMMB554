      <description>What is Python? Python is a modern, general-purpose, object-oriented, high-level programming language.
This material is heavily inspired by Materials for the course run by the Graduate School of Life Sciences, University of Cambridge with some modifications.  General characteristics of Python:  Clean and Simple: Easy-to-read and intuitive code, easy-to-learn minimalistic syntax, maintainability scales well with size of projects. Expressive: Fewer lines of code, fewer bugs, easier to maintain.</description>

      <description>Welcome to Notebooks An important assumption for this lecture is that (1) you have a Google account, (2) know how to use Google Drive, and (3) also have an active GitHub account.  When you start an analysis, you don&amp;rsquo;t really know how it will go. Maybe data is bad and there is no real reason to analyze anything at all. Maybe data data outliers that need to be dealt with.</description>

Introduction In the first class of the semester you will not learn much. It is more about me learning about you and you learning about each other.
Test 0 It would be helpful for me to know what you know and what you don&amp;rsquo;t. Take the test below. It will not be scored and will have no effect on your grade.
